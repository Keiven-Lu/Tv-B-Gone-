#Tv B Gone

Use Arduino 1.0.6

The TV-B-Gone速 universal remote is designed to turn almost any TV on or off, focusing solely on the power function. It operates by emitting a pulsing, invisible infrared (IR) light. While IR light is constantly present around us, TV remote controls use unique IR pulse patterns to avoid confusion with ordinary IR light. Each TV manufacturer has its own specific IR pulse patterns for different functions.

The TV-B-Gone速 remote replicates these various IR pulse patterns for power functions by using a small computer chip that sends out correctly timed pulses from a stored database to an IR LED. Unlike other universal remotes, which can control multiple functions, the TV-B-Gone速 only sends power codes.

When you activate the TV-B-Gone速, it starts by sending out a sequence of power codes for all TVs in its database. This process takes approximately 69 seconds for the North American and Asian models, and about 62 seconds for the European model. To minimize wait time, the remote prioritizes sending the power codes for the most common TVs first. As a result, around 90% of TVs will turn off within the first 17 seconds for the North American and Asian models, or within 12 seconds for the European model. After completing the sequence, the remote automatically turns itself off.
